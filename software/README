Code to predict the number of variants to be discovered in a large sample based on the distribution of allele frequencies in a subset of the sample. jack.py uses a jackknife approach, while lp.py uses a linear programming approach. Details about the software can be found in my paper  http://www.genetics.org/content/197/2/601.abstract.
